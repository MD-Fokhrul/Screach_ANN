# Screach_ANN

We build a neural network which have one hidden layer. And got good accuracy for training and test set.
This code-section was help to visualize basic structure of nn. There have a lot of work to improve. 

### Important keyword for this model: 
* Dataset: [Churn Modealing](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling) (very known business dataset)
* Cost function: [MSE](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-mean-squared-error-regression-line-c7dde9a26b93/)
* Activation: [sigmoid](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-mean-squared-error-regression-line-c7dde9a26b93/) (can use [relu](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-mean-squared-error-regression-line-c7dde9a26b93/)!)
* accuracy: arround 80% for traing and test dataset both
* Used modeule: numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn (for preprocesing and model evalution checking). For learn more about those modeule go [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-python-libraries-for-machine-learning/).
#### you can also check my nn model which built with [keras](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras-17c09e4f0eb2) for same dataset (and compare those) [here](https://github.com/MD-Fokhrul/ANN-Python). 

## ENJOY!!!
